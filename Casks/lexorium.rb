  caveats <<~EOS
    This app requires Rosetta 2 to run on Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Macs.
    If Rosetta 2 is not already installed, you can install it by running:
    
      softwareupdate --install-rosetta

    After Rosetta 2 is installed, you can run the app normally.
    
    Note: Due to macOS security settings, you may need to right-click the app and choose 'Open' to allow it to run the first time.
